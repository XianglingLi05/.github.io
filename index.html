<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Xiangling Li, a postdoctoral fellow with  Prof. Hangbo Zhao at the Viterbi School of Engineering of the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, United States. Before this, I earned my Ph.D. from the State Key Laboratory of Optoelectronic Materials and Technology (OEMT), Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China, in 2022, under the supervision of Prof. Xi Xie. My research interests lie in using advanced micro/nano manufacturing technologies to fabricate malleable electronics; developing novel precision medical devices that integrate and facilitate the intersection of mechanical engineering, materials science, chemistry, and life sciences; exploring new technologies, and expanding the application of these technologies in biomedical engineering.
<p>Any research collaboration is welcome, please get in touch with me at the email address:
